Welcome to the **SAASS Scheduler**.

This tool assigns students to balanced course groups using optimization submitted to the [NEOS Server](https://neos-server.org). 
---

### 📥 What You'll Need

Upload a `.csv` file with the following **two columns**, with these exact headers:

| Student Name | AFSC |
|--------------|------|
| Jenkins-P    | 15A  |
| Smith-J      | 11F  |
| Brown-M      | Marine |
| Taylor-A     | Civ  |
| Carter-B     | Army |

---

### ⚠️ Formatting Guidelines (Important)

- ✅ **Student Name** must follow the format: `LastName-FirstInitial` (no spaces).
- ✅ **AFSC** must be labeled **consistently**:
  - If the student is **not** from the Air Force, use an appropriate identifier. For example: `"Marine"`, `"Army"`, or `"Civ"` (case-sensitive, spelled exactly).  
  - Use consistent formatting for all AFSCs or job titles. For example, if you use `"15A"`, apply that format universally. Do **not** mix variants like `"15-A"`, `"15a"`, or `"Ops Research"`.
- 🚫 Do **not** include extra columns or leave blank rows.
- ✅ An **email address is required**, as the NEOS server uses it to process the optimization job.

🧠 **Why it matters:**  
The optimization model enforces a constraint that **no more than two members with the same AFSC or job title** can be assigned to a single group. Inconsistent or misspelled entries will bypass this constraint and reduce solution quality.
